## Core Components

- **MDEAutomator PowerShell Module**  
  Provides cmdlets for authentication, profile management, live response, response actions, custom detections, advanced hunting and threat indicator management in MDE.

- **Azure Function Apps**
  - **MDEDispatcher**  
    Automates bulk management of response actions delivered to endpoints:
    - `InvokeMachineIsolation`: Performs selective network isolation. (respects exclusion rules)
    - `UndoMachineIsolation`: Removes network isolation.
    - `InvokeContainDevice`: Instructs endpoints to deny all connections from this device.
    - `UndoContainDevice`: Restores communication with endpoints.
    - `InvokeRestrictAppExecution`: Enables Microsoft-only code integrity policy. (Microsoft-signed code only permitted to run)
    - `UndoRestrictAppExecution`- Removes Microsoft-only code integrity policy.
    - `InvokeCollectInvestigationPackage` - Collects Investigation Packages and uploads them to the `packages` blob container.
    - `InvokeStopAndQuarantineFile` - Searches for file on disk, encrypts the file and saves the file in the local WDAV quarantine folder.
    - `InvokeFullDiskScan` - Starts Full-disk WDAV scan jobs.
  - **MDEOrchestrator**  
    Automates bulk management of Live Response commands:
    - `InvokeUploadLR`- Uploads local file to Live Response Library using byte array.
    - `InvokePutFile`- Pushes file from Live Response Library to the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\Downloads` folder on the endpoints.
    - `InvokeGetFile`- Retrieves file from endpoint and uploads to the `files` blob container.
    - `InvokeLRScript`- Runs live response script from Live Response Library on the endpoint.
  - **MDEProfiles**  
    Automates bulk delivery of custom PowerShell scripts to configure policy on MDE endpoints:
    - `Active`- This configures specific Set-MpPreference settings, registry settings, Attack Surface Reduction rules, Exploit Protection, and Windows Defender Application Control settings on endpoints. 
    - `Passive`- This configures specific Set-MpPreference settings and Attack Surface Reduction rules on endpoints.
  - **MDETIManager**  
    Automates management of Threat Indicators (IOCs) in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:
    - `InvokeTiFile` / `UndoTiFile`: Creates/removes file hash-based indicators (SHA1/SHA256)
    - `InvokeTiIP` / `UndoTiIP`: Creates/removes IP address-based indicators
    - `InvokeTiURL` / `UndoTiURL`: Creates/removes URL and domain-based indicators
    - `InvokeTiCert` / `UndoTiCert`: Creates/removes certificate-based indicators (by thumbprint)
  - **MDEAutoHunt**  
    Automates bulk threat hunting and exports output to Azure Storage:
    - Relays groups of KQL queries to the MDE API, exports responses as JSON, and saves to Azure Storage.
  - **MDECDManager**  
    Automates synchronization of Custom Detections from a blob container:
    - Installs or updates Defender Custom Detections based on JSON files in the Detections blob container.

## Security Notes

> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> MDEAutomator is a powerful tool that, if misused by a threat actor, could cause significant harm. Treat all credentials, scripts, and deployments with the highest level of security.

### App Service Authentication
Critical! Configure Authentication on the Azure App Service so Entra ID auth is required before MDEAutomator's control panel.

   ![Auth](./media/auth.png)

### PowerShell Security Hygiene

- **Sign all PowerShell scripts:**  
  Clone this repository and use an [Azure Trusted Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/quickstart) account to sign every PowerShell script with your own signing key.
- A signing script (`signscripts.ps1`) is included in the `payloads` subfolder to assist with this process.
- After signing, redeploy the zip package containing the signed scripts to your Azure Function.
- This allows you to **disable unsigned script execution** in MDE Advanced Settings without losing any functionality.

> **Note:**  
> Azure Trusted Signing is currently available only to organizations based in the USA and Canada with a verifiable history of three years or more.

#### Module Documentation

## 1. Connect-MDE

**Description:**  
Authenticates to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) using a Service Principal/UMI Federation or $SpnSecret.

The `-SpnId` parameter is the Application (client) ID of your Azure Service Principal. This value uniquely identifies the app registration in Entra ID (Azure AD) that will be used for authentication. You can find this value in the Azure portal under your App Registration's overview page.

The `-SpnSecret` parameter is the client secret associated with your Service Principal. This should be provided as a secure string. Always store and handle this secret securely.

The `-ManagedIdentityId` parameter specifies the Client ID of the User Managed Identity associated with MDEAutomator. 

The `-TenantId` parameter is the Entra ID tenant ID where your Service Principal is registered. This is typically a GUID. If not specified, the module will use the tenant associated with your current Azure context.

**Parameters:**
- `-SpnId` (string, required): Service Principal App ID.
- `-SpnSecret` (securestring, optional): Service Principal secret.
- `-ManagedIdentityId` (string, optional): The Client ID of the MDEAutomator User-Managed Identity.
- `-TenantId` (string, optional): Entra ID Tenant ID or default to home tenant.

**Example:**
```powershell
# Using UMI + Federated App Registration
$token = Connect-MDE -SpnId "<SPNappId>" -ManagedIdentityId "<UMIappId>"

# Using direct secret
$secureSecret = Read-Host "Enter Secret" -AsSecureString
$token = Connect-MDE -SpnId "<appId>" -SpnSecret $secureSecret -TenantId "<tenantId>"
```

## 2. Get-Machines
